# Recipe-App

The main goal of this application is to provide a user-friendly platform for recipe management. You can add recipes by filling out a form that includes the recipe name, ingredients, and instructions. You can also upload an image of the recipe to make it more visually appealing.

The app features a sleek and modern design, making it easy to navigate and use. The MVVM design pattern has been used to ensure the separation of concerns between the model, view, and view model.

The recipe collection is displayed using a UICollectionView, allowing for easy scrolling and browsing. Additionally, the app includes a search feature that enables users to search for specific recipes by name or ingredient.

One of the unique features of this app is the ability to create personalized recipe collections. Users can add recipes to their favorites list or create custom collections for easy organization.

Core Data is used for data persistence, ensuring that all user data is saved securely and efficiently. The app also includes several other features such as alerts, tap gestures, and custom UI components, all of which enhance the user experience.
