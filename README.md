# Recipe-App



* The main view of the application consists of a collection view with images and names of 40 different Pokemon.
Each cell of the collection view allows the user to access the detail page of the selected Pokemon.
Double-tapping to the cell shows the back side of the character. (I used protocol and tap gesture to implement this feature.)
Once tapped, the app will take you to the selected Pokemon's detail page.

* When we go to the detail view of the application, we see the back side of the pokemon card and when we click on it, the front side is flipped with an animation (I used pre written code for this feature.)
